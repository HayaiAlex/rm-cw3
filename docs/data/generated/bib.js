        "abstract": "\"{Essential genes are critical for the growth and survival of any organism. The machine learning approach complements the experimental methods to minimize the resources required for essentiality assays. Previous studies revealed the need to discover relevant features that significantly classify essential genes, improve on the generalizability of prediction models across organisms, and construct a robust gold standard as the class label for the train data to enhance prediction. Findings also show that a significant limitation of the machine learning approach is predicting conditionally essential genes. The essentiality status of a gene can change due to a specific condition of the organism. This review examines various methods applied to essential gene prediction task, their strengths, limitations and the factors responsible for effective computational prediction of essential genes. We discussed categories of features and how they contribute to the classification performance of essentiality prediction models. Five categories of features, namely, gene sequence, protein sequence, network topology, homology and gene ontology-based features, were generated for Caenorhabditis elegans to perform a comparative analysis of their essentiality prediction capacity. Gene ontology-based feature category outperformed other categories of features majorly due to its high correlation with the genes\u2019 biological functions. However, the topology feature category provided the highest discriminatory power making it more suitable for essentiality prediction. The major limiting factor of machine learning to predict essential genes conditionality is the unavailability of labeled data for interest conditions that can train a classifier. Therefore, cooperative machine learning could further exploit models that can perform well in conditional essentiality predictions.Identification of essential genes is imperative because it provides an understanding of the core structure and function, accelerating drug targets\u2019 discovery, among other functions. Recent studies have applied machine learning to complement the experimental identification of essential genes. However, several factors are limiting the performance of machine learning approaches. This review aims to present the standard procedure and resources available for predicting essential genes in organisms, and also highlight the factors responsible for the current limitation in using machine learning for conditional gene essentiality prediction. The choice of features and ML technique was identified as an important factor to predict essential genes effectively.}\",",

We employed machine learning across six model eukaryotes and 60 381 genes, using 41 635 features derived from the sequence, gene function information and network topology.

        "abstract": "\"{Background Essential proteins are crucial for cellular life and thus, identification of essential proteins is an important topic and a challenging problem for researchers. Recently lots of computational approaches have been proposed to handle this problem. However, traditional centrality methods cannot fully represent the topological features of biological networks. In addition, identifying essential proteins is an imbalanced learning problem; but few current shallow machine learning-based methods are designed to handle the imbalanced characteristics. Results We develop DeepEP based on a deep learning framework that uses the node2vec technique, multi-scale convolutional neural networks and a sampling technique to identify essential proteins. In DeepEP, the node2vec technique is applied to automatically learn topological and semantic features for each protein in protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Gene expression profiles are treated as images and multi-scale convolutional neural networks are applied to extract their patterns. In addition, DeepEP uses a sampling method to alleviate the imbalanced characteristics. The sampling method samples the same number of the majority and minority samples in a training epoch, which is not biased to any class in training process. The experimental results show that DeepEP outperforms traditional centrality methods. Moreover, DeepEP is better than shallow machine learning-based methods. Detailed analyses show that the dense vectors which are generated by node2vec technique contribute a lot to the improved performance. It is clear that the node2vec technique effectively captures the topological and semantic properties of PPI network. The sampling method also improves the performance of identifying essential proteins. Conclusion We demonstrate that DeepEP improves the prediction performance by integrating multiple deep learning techniques and a sampling method. DeepEP is more effective than existing methods.}\",",

        "abstract": "Essential gene prediction helps to find minimal genes indispensable for the survival of any organism. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been useful for the prediction of gene essentiality. However, currently available ML pipelines perform poorly for organisms with limited experimental data. The objective is the development of a new ML pipeline to help in the annotation of essential genes of less explored disease-causing organisms for which minimal experimental data is available. The proposed strategy combines unsupervised feature selection technique, dimension reduction using the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, and semi-supervised ML algorithm employing Laplacian Support Vector Machine (LapSVM) for prediction of essential and non-essential genes from genome-scale metabolic networks using very limited labeled dataset. A novel scoring technique, Semi-Supervised Model Selection Score, equivalent to area under the ROC curve (auROC), has been proposed for the selection of the best model when supervised performance metrics calculation is difficult due to lack of data. The unsupervised feature selection followed by dimension reduction helped to observe a distinct circular pattern in the clustering of essential and non-essential genes. LapSVM then created a curve that dissected this circle for the classification and prediction of essential genes with high accuracy (auROC > 0.85) even with 1% labeled data for model training. After successful validation of this ML pipeline on both Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes that show high accuracy even when the labeled dataset is very limited, this strategy is used for the prediction of essential genes of organisms with inadequate experimentally known data, such as Leishmania sp. Using a graph-based semi-supervised machine learning scheme, a novel integrative approach has been proposed for essential gene prediction that shows universality in application to both Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes with limited labeled data. The essential genes predicted using the pipeline provide an important lead for the prediction of gene essentiality and identification of novel therapeutic targets for antibiotic and vaccine development against disease-causing parasites.",

        "abstract": "Essential proteins are considered the foundation of life as they are indispensable for the survival of living organisms. Computational methods for essential protein discovery provide a fast way to identify essential proteins. But most of them heavily rely on various biological information, especially protein-protein interaction networks, which limits their practical applications. With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology, sequencing data has become the most accessible biological data. However, using only protein sequence information to predict essential proteins has limited accuracy. In this paper, we propose EP-EDL, an ensemble deep learning model using only protein sequence information to predict human essential proteins. EP-EDL integrates multiple classifiers to alleviate the class imbalance problem and to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. In each base classifier, we employ multi-scale text convolutional neural networks to extract useful features from protein sequence feature matrices with evolutionary information. Our computational results show that EP-EDL outperforms the state-of-the-art sequence-based methods. Furthermore, EP-EDL provides a more practical and flexible way for biologists to accurately predict essential proteins.

        "abstract": "Essential genes are subset of genes required by an organism for growth and sustenance of life and as well responsible for phenotypic changes when their activities are altered. They have been utilized as drug targets, disease control agent, etc. Essential genes have been widely identified especially in microorganisms, due to the extensive experimental studies on some of them such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Experimental approach has been a reliable method to identify essential genes. However, it is complex, costly, labour and time intensive. Therefore, computational approach has been developed to complement the experimental approach in order to minimize resources required for essentiality identification experiments. Machine learning approaches have been widely used to predict essential genes in model organisms using different categories of features with varying degrees of accuracy and performance. However, previous studies have not established the most important categories of features that provide the distinguishing power in machine learning essentiality predictions. Therefore, this study evaluates the discriminating strength of major categories of features used in essential gene prediction task as well as the factors responsible for effective computational prediction. Four categories of features were considered and k- fold cross-validation machine learning technique was used to build the classification model. Our results show that ontology features with an AUROC score of 0.936 has the most discriminating power to classify essential and non-essential genes. This studyconcludes that more ontology related features will further improve the performance of machine learning approach and also sensitivity, precision and AUPRC are realistic measures of performance in essentiality prediction.",

        "abstract": "The identification of essential genes, i.e. those that impair cell survival when deleted, requires large growth assays of knock-out strains. The complexity and cost of such experiments has triggered a growing interest in computational methods for prediction of gene essentiality. In the case of metabolic genes, Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is widely employed to predict essentiality under the assumption that cells maximize their growth rate. However, this approach assumes that knock-out strains optimize the same objectives as the wild-type, which excludes cases in which deletions cause large physiological changes to meet other objectives for survival. Here, we resolve this limitation with a novel machine learning approach that predicts essentiality directly from wild-type flux distributions. We first project the wild-type FBA solution onto a mass flow graph, a digraph with reactions as nodes and edge weights proportional to the mass transfer between reactions, and then train binary classifiers on the connectivity of graph nodes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using the most complete metabolic model of Escherichia coli, achieving near state-of-the art prediction accuracy for essential genes. Our approach suggests that wild-type FBA solutions contain enough information to predict essentiality, without the need to assume optimality of deletion strains.",
